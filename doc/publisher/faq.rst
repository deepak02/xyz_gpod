Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How can I add my podcast?
-------------------------

If your podcast is missing from the gpodder.net directory, go to
https://gpodder.net/missing/ and enter the URL of your podcast feed.


How can I add a logo / description / etc?
-----------------------------------------

All information of a podcast is retrieved from the podcast feed. To add some
information on gpodder.net, add it to the podcast feed and it will be shown on
gpodder.net after the next update.


How often is my podcast updated?
--------------------------------

This depends on how often your podcast publishes new episodes. Basically we use
the average time between episodes as the update interval.


How can I ensure my podcast is up-to-date?
------------------------------------------

There are several ways

* Use `Pubsubhubbub <https://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/>`_. Your hub will then
  trigger the podcast update whenever a new episode is released.

* Request a `Publisher account <https://gpodder.net/publisher/>`_. You can then
  trigger an update of your podcast on gpodder.net manually.

* `Donate <https://gpodder.net/contribute/>`_. If we have more resources
  available for updating podcast feeds, all podcasts will be updated quicker.
