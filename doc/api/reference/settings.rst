Settings API
============

Clients can store settings and retrieve settings as key-value-pairs, which are
attached to either account, device, podcast or episode.

Keys are the names of the settings and are supposed to be strings. Values can
be any valid JSON objects.


Known Settings
--------------

Although settings are primarily used to exchange settings between clients, some
of them also trigger some behavior on the website.

Account
^^^^^^^

* ``public_profile``: when set to False, sets all podcasts to private
  (as on http://gpodder.net/account/privacy, currently deactivated via API)
* ``store_user_agent``: allow gpodder.net to store the User-Agent for each
  device (default: true)
* ``public_subscriptions``: default "public" value for subscriptions (default:
  true)

Episode
^^^^^^^

* ``is_favorite``: flags the episode as favorite (can be done on any
  episode-page)

Podcast
^^^^^^^

* ``public_subscription``: when set to False, sets the subscription to this
  podcast to private (as on http://gpodder.net/account/privacy or any
  podcast-page, currently deactivated via API)
